Title: The dragon's wife
Author: Teresita C. G. Nader

Prolog:
There was an ancient time when humans and dragons coexisted peacefully, the dragons
were considered gods to the people. They ruled the skies and protected all humans from danger.
There was only one rule, love between dragons and humans was forbidden. Dragons were able to take human form
and live with humans, but they were not allowing to marry humans. The mere thought that dragon families could be
mixed with the impure humans was unthinkable. There was one dragon king that ruled the skies with an iron fist
and battled with fiery courage. No human, nor even dragons could face him in battle, but his heart was dark as the sky in the night.
One day while he was in battle he got wounded, to not appear weak in front of his peers he transformed into human form
and went to the healing waters of the (east)(west)-choose later-
There he meets a beautiful young woman, and he fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and brought her to the dragon
kingdom. Night after night, she rejected his love. She was in love with another man. She begged every night to return
to his beloved but the dragon king denied to give his beloved woman to another man.

With a broken heart the young woman ended up killing herself, as a punishment the skies imprisoned the dragons in the sky. Never more would they be able to come down to where the humans were.
