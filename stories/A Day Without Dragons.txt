Title: A Day Without Dragons
Author: Teresita C. G. Nader

Prolog:
There was an ancient time when humans and dragons coexisted peacefully, the dragons
were considered gods to the people. They ruled the skies and protected all humans from danger.
There was only one rule, love between dragons and humans was forbidden. Dragons were able to take human form
and live among humans, but they were not allow to marry humans. The mere thought that dragon's blood could be
mixed with the impure human's blood was unthinkable. There was one dragon king that ruled the skies with an iron claw
and battled with fiery courage. No human, nor even dragons could face him in battle, but his heart was darker than a obsidian.
One day while he was in battle he got wounded. Afraid that his dragon peers will think that he was weak he hided his wounds from them.
At night he tranformed into human form and went to the healing hot springs of the east.
There he met a beautiful young woman, and he fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and brought her to the dragon
kingdom. Night after night, she rejected his love. She was in love with another man. She begged every night to return
to his beloved but the dragon king denied to give his beloved woman to another man.

With a broken heart the young woman ended her life. As a punishment the skies imprisoned the dragons in the sky. 
Till then dragons were not allow to come near humans or interfiere on their lives.

Hundred of years have passed and nobody have seen a dragon since then, but the times are changing and the skies claim for revenge.
